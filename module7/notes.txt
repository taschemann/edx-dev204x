For this assignment, let's make some changes to your code to move from arrays to collections.
Complete the following using your project from Module 6:

Delete the Student array in your Course object that you created in Module 5.
Create an ArrayList to replace the array and to hold students, inside the Course object.
Modify your code to use the ArrayList collection as the replacement to the array.  In other words, 
  when you add a Student to the Course object, you will add it to the ArrayList and not an array.
Create a Stack object inside the Student object, called Grades, to store test scores.
Create 3 student objects.
Add 5 grades to the the Stack in the each Student object. (this does not have to be inside the 
  constructor because you may not have grades for a student when you create a new student.)
Add the three Student objects to the Students ArrayList inside the Course object.
Using a foreach loop, iterate over the Students in the ArrayList and output their first and last 
  names to the console window. (For this exercise you MUST cast the returned object from the ArrayList
  to a Student object.  Also, place each student name on its own line)
Create a method inside the Course object called ListStudents() that contains the foreach loop.
Call the ListStudents() method from Main().
Grading Criteria:

Used an ArrayList of Students, inside the Course object.
Added a Stack called Grades inside the Student object.
Added 3 Student objects to this ArrayList using the ArrayList method for adding objects.
Used a foreach loop to output the first and last name of each Student in the ArrayList.
Cast the object from the ArrayList to Student, inside the foreach loop, before printing out the name information.
Challenge:  (NOT to be assessed in Peer Review)

Sort the ArrayList of students.
Use a foreach loop to output the student names to see if the sort performed what you expect.
To simulate changing a grade for a student, remove the last entered grade and replace it with a new one.
Bonus challenge:  Ensure you have added at least 5 grades to the stack.  Replace the third grade in the stack without losing the two grades above it.
Iterate over the student collection and output the first and last name along with each of the 5 grades for that student.

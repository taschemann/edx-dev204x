For this assignment you will use your project from Module 7 and will use Generic collections in place
  of the existing collections.

Create a List<T>, of the proper data type, to replace the ArrayList and to hold students, inside the
  Course object.
Modify your code to use the List<T> collection as the replacement to the ArrayList. 
Create a Stack<T> object, of the proper data type, inside the Student object, called Grades, to store
  test scores.
Create 3 student objects.
Add 5 grades to the the Stack<T>  in the each Student object. (this does not have to be inside the
  constructor because you may not have grades for a student when you create a new student.)
Add the three Student objects to the List<T>  inside the Course object.
Using a foreach loop, iterate over the Students in the List<T> and output their first and last names 
  to the console window. (For this exercise, casting is no longer required.  Also, place each student
  name on its own line)
Create a method inside the Course object called ListStudents() that contains the foreach loop.
Call the ListStudents() method from Main().
Grading Criteria:

Used a List<T> collection of the proper data type, inside the Course object.
Added a Stack<T> of the proper data type, called Grades, inside the Student object.
Added 3 Student objects to this List<T> using the List<T> method for adding objects.
Used a foreach loop to output the first and last name of each Student in the List<T>.
Challenge:  (NOT to be assessed in Peer Review)

To simulate changing a grade for a student, remove the last entered grade and replace it with a new one.
Research the Generic collections on http://msdn.microsoft.com and find a Generic collection to store grades in a sorted order. 
Implement that Generic collection in place of the Stack<T> in the Student object.
Iterate over the student collection and output the first and last name along with each of the 5 grades for that student.
